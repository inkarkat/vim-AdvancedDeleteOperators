DESCRIPTION				 *AdvancedDeleteOperators-description*

Editing text mainly means changing or deleting stuff, in the latter case often
to paste it somewhere else. Often, some whitespace is "in the way": For
example, you want to change some text, and there's a convenient motion to the
end of it. But the whitespace after that has to be removed as well. It's then
either visual mode to really select what you need, or a separate removal after
the edit which breaks repeatability with the |.| command. Or you want to
delete a text column (including trailing whitespace), but then want to reuse
only the text without the spaces.
This plugin provides additional |c|hange and |d|elete operators that work on
moved-over text or a selection (just like the original built-in operators),
but also remove trailing whitespace (or condense it to a single space).

==============================================================================
USAGE					       *AdvancedDeleteOperators-usage*

WHITESPACE								     *
			       *c<Space>* *v_c<Space>* *d<Space>* *v_d<Space>*
["x]c<Space>{motion}	Delete text that {motion} moves over [into
			register x], reduce any whitespace after it to a
			single space, and start insert.
{Visual}["x]c<Space>}	Delete selected text [into register x], reduce any
			whitespace after it to a single space, and start
			insert.
["x]d<Space>{motion}	Delete text that {motion} moves over [into register x]
			and reduce any whitespace after it to a single space.
{Visual}["x]d<Space>	Delete selected text [into register x] and reduce any
			whitespace after it to a single space.
					   *c<BS>* *v_c<BS>* *d<BS>* *v_d<BS>*
["x]c<BS>{motion}	Delete text that {motion} moves over [into
			register x], remove any whitespace after it, and start
			insert.
{Visual}["x]c<BS>	Delete selected text [into register x], remove any
			whitespace after it, and start insert.
["x]d<BS>{motion}	Delete text that {motion} moves over [into register x]
			and remove any whitespace after it.
{Visual}["x]d<BS>	Delete selected text [into register x] and remove any
			whitespace after it.

BLACK HOLE								     *
								     *X* *v_X*
X, v_X			Delete [count] characters under and after the cursor
			without affecting any registers. Useful when you want
			to re-use the previous delete into the unnamed
			register.
			Note: I never used the original |X|, which can be done
			via either "dh[dh...]" or "i<BS>[<BS>...]<Esc>".
							 *cX* *cXX* *dX* *dXX*
cX{motion}		Delete text that {motion} moves over without affecting
			any registers and start insert.
cXX			Delete [count] lines without affecting any registers
			and start insert.
dX{motion}		Delete text that {motion} moves over without affecting
			any registers.
dXX			Delete [count] lines without affecting any registers.


REMAINDER								     *
							    *dDD* *dD* *v_,dD*
["x]dDD			Delete the characters under the cursor until the end
			of the line and [count]-1 more lines [into register
			x], and delete the remainder of the line (i.e. the
			characters before the cursor) and possibly following
			empty line(s) without affecting a register.
["x]dD{motion}		Delete text that {motion} moves over [into register x]
			and delete the remainder of the line(s) and possibly
			following empty line(s) without affecting a register.
{Visual}["x],dD		Delete the highlighted text [into register x] and
			delete the remainder of the selected line(s) and
			possibly following empty line(s) without affecting a
			register.

EXAMPLE					     *AdvancedDeleteOperators-example*

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				*AdvancedDeleteOperators-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-AdvancedDeleteOperators
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim AdvancedDeleteOperators*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				*AdvancedDeleteOperators-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.039 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION			       *AdvancedDeleteOperators-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
			     *g:AdvancedDeleteOperators_no_blackhole_mappings*
To avoid defining the mappings that default to |quote_| (and clobber the X
command): >
    let g:AdvancedDeleteOperators_no_blackhole_mappings = 1
<

					       *AdvancedDeleteOperators-remap*
If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the following mapping
targets _before_ sourcing the script (e.g. in your |vimrc|): >
    nmap d<Space> <Plug>(DeleteCondenseWhitespaceOperator)
    xmap ,d<Space> <Plug>(DeleteCondenseWhitespaceVisual)
    nmap c<Space> <Plug>(ChangeCondenseWhitespaceOperator)
    xmap ,c<Space> <Plug>(ChangeCondenseWhitespaceVisual)
    nmap d<BS> <Plug>(DeleteRemoveWhitespaceOperator)
    xmap ,d<BS> <Plug>(DeleteRemoveWhitespaceVisual)
    nmap c<BS> <Plug>(ChangeRemoveWhitespaceOperator)
    xmap ,c<BS> <Plug>(ChangeRemoveWhitespaceVisual)
